# Pynomic
*Pynomic* is a Python library that allows you to fast extract data from aereal images from plant breeding trials in a simple, trackable and automatized way.

## Motivation
The use of drones in agricultures is beeing widely spread due to its versatility from plant treatmenta aplication, sowing, scouting crops, etc. In plant breeding it allows to capture large amounts of data 
that need to be processed in order to extract usefull information. Hence Pynomic the tool that to sovle this porblem. It combines librarys to get the best of them making it able to fast extract the data, plot each treatment and it's evolution
throwgh time, estimate the date of a event given a certain threshold, automaticaly calculate RGB and Multispectra vegetation indices while at the same time reducing the need for RAM soring the important information in a compressed manner.
